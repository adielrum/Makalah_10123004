## Adding New Algorithms

To add a new vertex cover algorithm:

1. **Create Algorithm File**:
   ```python
   # algorithms/my_algorithm.py
   from typing import Generator
   from models import Graph, StepResult, VertexCoverResult
   
   def run(graph: Graph) -> Generator[StepResult, None, VertexCoverResult]:
       # Your algorithm implementation
       pass
   
   def get_algorithm_info() -> dict:
       return {
           "name": "My Algorithm",
           "description": "Description of your algorithm",
           "time_complexity": "O(n)",
           "approximation_ratio": None,
           "optimal": False
       }
   ```

2. **Register Algorithm**:
   Add your algorithm to `AVAILABLE_ALGORITHMS` in `algorithms/__init__.py`:
   ```python
   AVAILABLE_ALGORITHMS = {
       "2-Approximation": "two_approximation",
       "Greedy": "greedy",
       "My Algorithm": "my_algorithm"  # Add this line
   }
   ```

## Algorithm Interface

All algorithms must implement the following interface:

```python
def run(graph: Graph) -> Generator[StepResult, None, VertexCoverResult]:
    """
    Run the vertex cover algorithm
    
    Args:
        graph: Input graph
        
    Yields:
        StepResult: Information about each algorithm step
        
    Returns:
        VertexCoverResult: Final algorithm result
    """
```

### StepResult Fields
- `vertex_cover_so_far`: Current vertex cover
- `remaining_edges`: Edges not yet covered
- `message`: Description of the current step
- `selected_edge`: Currently selected edge (optional)
- `added_vertices`: Vertices added in this step (optional)
- `removed_edges`: Edges removed in this step (optional)

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **PyQt6**: Modern GUI framework for the user interface
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations (if needed for advanced algorithms)

### Design Patterns
- **Model-View-Controller**: Separation of data, presentation, and logic
- **Observer Pattern**: Signal-slot mechanism for component communication
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable algorithm system

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient graph data structures using sets for O(1) lookups
- Lazy evaluation using generators for step-by-step execution
- Optimized rendering with Qt's graphics system

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PyQt6 Installation Issues**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install PyQt6
   ```

2. **Application Won't Start**:
   - Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
   - Check that all dependencies are installed
   - Try running with `python -m main`

3. **Graph Not Displaying**:
   - Check that vertices have been added
   - Ensure the canvas has focus
   - Try resizing the window

### Performance Tips
- For large graphs (>100 vertices), consider using manual step execution
- Reduce animation speed for better performance on slower systems
- Close other applications to free up system resources
